# Data Processing with PySpark and Delta Lake on AWS EMR

This is the companion code for the Unskew data blog post [here](https://unskewdata.com/blog/pyspark-emr-delta).

We use PySpark to process data and write it to S3 as a delta lake table. Later, we discuss how to deploy this PySpark application to EMR.

As always, please [write](mailto:contactunskewdata@gmail.com) to us with any questions, comments or improvements.
